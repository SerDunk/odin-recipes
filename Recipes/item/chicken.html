    <h1>Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <br>

    <li>1/2 cup Caesar salad croutons, crushed</li>
    <br>

    <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
    <br>

    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (1 1/2 to 2 pounds total)</li>
    <br>
    

    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <br>

    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <br>

    <li>1 cup creamy Caesar salad dressing</li>
    <br>

    <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
    <br>

    <li>1 tablespoon all purpose flour<br>
        Chopped fresh parsley to taste for garnish</li>
    <br>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat a 2-quart baking dish with nonstick spray.<br>
            Combine crushed croutons, Parmesan cheese, and butter; toss to mix. Set aside.<br>
            Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Pound to an even thickness with a meat mallet.<br>
        </li>
             <br>

        <li>Sprinkle with pepper and salt on both sides and place chicken into the prepared baking dish.<br>
            Stir together salad dressing, sour cream, and flour in a small bowl.<br>
            Spoon salad dressing mixture over chicken and turn to coat.</li>
            <br>

        <li>Top with crouton mixture.
            Bake in the preheated oven until topping is browned and chicken is longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes.<br>
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with parsley. 
        </li>
        <br>
            
    </ol>
